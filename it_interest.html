							<h1 class="major">What makes IT so Interesting?</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Ever since I was a child I have been interested in anything IT.
								I have always needed the newest hardware and software, but unfortunately,
								as I have grown up, I have realised just how expensive it can get. When I
								was younger, my older brother and I would play around with the hardware and
								firmware on whatever computer, phone, and console we could find. For years I have
								been coming up with ideas of different IT projects for me to do, although due to
								not having money, I have only just started accomplishing some of these projects. I
								decided to join RMIT because I want to expand my knowledge in the IT industry and
								execute my projects and dreams. Out of all the universities I researched, RMIT seemed
								to be the best option for me. Through this course, I don't fully know what to expect,
								other than getting the skills to help me accomplish my goals of becoming an IT Technician.</p>
							<h3>My current dream job</h3>
							<p>So far, a Field Technician job would be ideal for me. Geeks2U was hiring a Field Technician
								back in June in my area. I had applied for this job at the time but was unsuccessful. But
								that will not stop me from applying again once I have completed this course. The job required
								someone who could diagnose issues the clients encountered and use their knowledge and experience
								to troubleshoot and resolve the problems. I found this job appealing because it involves interacting
								with customers face to face, which is something that I thrive on. I love building that rapport with
								customers as it makes explaining tech issues to the less tech-savvy people more fun. For example,
								I sometimes use an analogy by comparing a computer system with a car, or even the human body to help
								people understand. Not only would my experience with building rapport help, but also my experience with
								computer systems, phones, and other IT aspects would help.
								</p>
							<p>However, I would love to expand my knowledge. I don't fully understand the interior hardware of a
								system or even networks, which I would love to understand more, especially if it is required to help a
								business with a failing network system. I would love to resolve it quickly and confidently, and I know
								that this course will help me in that regard.</p>
