							<h1 class="major">My Project Idea!</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My project idea is to build a device that connects to my car and
								alerts me whenever the vehicle has been locked and unlocked via a
								notification on mine and my partner's phone. I would like to name
								this project, "cLock." It will send this notification either via an
								application that I create or through an SMS message. To do this, the
								device will need to be connected to a network at all times. If successful,
								I would commercialize the device/application and possibly, in the future,
								expand the functionality of the app and allow the user to unlock and lock
								their car from the application and perhaps even allowing them to start the vehicle remotely.</p>

							<p>Many cars, old and new, don't make much noise whenever you lock or unlock them; this causes
								many drivers to check if their vehicle is locked by using the handle. I want drivers to have
								the confidence that their car is locked, so they never have to walk back to their car and
								check, and never have to worry while they are in the middle of watching a movie at the
								cinemas or the beach. I am motivated to create this project because one morning, as my
								fiancé and I were heading off to work, I noticed I left the car unlocked all night because
								I didn't hear the silent "click!" sound my car makes.</p>

							<p>The product "cLock" will be made possible by using Onboard Diagnostics II (OBD2).
								OBD2 is a diagnostic system that is in cars post-1996. This tells mechanics what
								issues are going on with the car, allowing the technician to determine the problem
								instead of guessing. Nowadays, OBD2 can be used for many different functions, such
								as controlling windows, doors, radios, and location tracking. There are a variety
								of other things it can do. This is why I have decided to use it for this project.
								With cLock, I am thinking of connecting it with a Raspberry Pi, similar to the <a href="https://www.autopi.io/blog/what-is-autopi-and-what-does-it-do/">
								AutoPi.</a> Due to the customizability and functionality of the Raspberry Pi, I
								will hopefully be able to connect it to the cars OBD2 port easily and onto a network
								using a 3G – 4G/LTE Base HAT from sixfab. To create the application, I will possibly
								use Java, as that's the programming language that I am learning at RMIT; however, I do
								not know how effective using Java would be for the project I would like to create.</p>

							<p>After connecting to the car and a network, it would also connect to an application on
								the chosen device. To make it secure, the user would have to sign up for an account,
								so other people will not access their car's locking system.  Although to begin with,
								cLock will only alert the user when their car has been locked or unlocked. Eventually,
								as I figure out how to, I would love to set it up so the device could allow the user to
								remotely unlock their car, roll their windows down, remotely diagnose issues with their cars,
								and possibly start the engine remotely as well. If I can accomplish all of this, it would
								allow mechanics, car enthusiasts, and just regular people to diagnose and solve issues themselves.
								Included with the diagnostics tool, cLock would explain what you require to fix the problems and whether it is recommended to go to a mechanic.</p>
								
								<p>For the project, some programming knowledge would is necessary. This would be
								needed to create the application and help translate what the car is saying to
								the Raspberry Pi. The hardware which I would need would, of course, be a car,
								which I have got (Suzuki Swift 2018) and a Raspberry Pi. Connected to the Raspberry
								Pi would be two HATS if they are compatible with each other. One of them would be the
								Pi-OBD add-on board and a 3G – 4G/LTE Base HAT. Obtaining the hardware should be easy;
								it can all be purchased online from different retailers. I will need to get a deeper
								understanding of cars, so I may need to adopt some help from friends, family, and local mechanics.</p>

							<p>If cLock is successful, an alert will be available via phone. I will proceed to do further testing on
								family and friends' cars and mobile devices using this project. Once it has proven successful and I
								gain more skills, I will then expand the functionality of the project for vehicle diagnostic purposes.</p>
